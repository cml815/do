1. I wanted to start a blog and thought it was going to be pretty straightforward but as it turned out, it wasn't. So I put an ad out on LinkedIn for some help. Caroline responded very quickly and offered her help building this website and getting it up and running for me. 
2. Caroline and I first talked on the phone about what I was expecting and what I wanted out of this blog. She did not rush me and was very enthusiastic about helping me through this process. We agreed on what the work would entail and she began working immediately. She helped me so much to get my blog up and running and walked me through the issues I was having to help me understand it better. 
3. There were some mishaps along the way with the system, itself, but Caroline always responded quickly with any questions I had and worked through this issue until it was fixed. I'm so grateful for all she has done!

They helped me get my blog up and running and walked me through the issues I was having. Also, they responded quickly with questions I had. I'm so grateful for all they have done!

We assigned an exclusive feature-length article on a complex scientific topic, for a new publication still defining its scope and voice. The results were exactly what we needed and helped us to launch the publication successfully.

Caroline has been part of the McAllister & Quinn grant writer network for nearly two years. Over this time, I have worked with Caroline on a variety of projects. She is very knowledgeable about the Federal grant process, and how to effectively respond to funding opportunities. Caroline is able to successfully lead grant writing efforts on a variety of health care related topics from system level opportunities to scientific research proposals. 

Beyond her writing abilities, Caroline does a great job working with a variety of clients from very research savvy PIâ€™s to brand new Program Directors and faculty members. She is able to help lead the client through the grant writing process asking key questions and allowing them to focus on program development and/or research strategies.

Caroline excels in all aspects of grant writing, from putting pen to paper, working with clients and overall time management. I look forward to my continued work with her.

Fuel Copy tightened up my proposals and made them smarter, and more graceful. Their guidance included important insights into what would catch the eye of each granting agency. Glad to have them on my team.
