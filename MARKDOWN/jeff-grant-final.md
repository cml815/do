BACKGROUND

Fuel finds talented influencers who bring charisma, expertise and a large following to team with brands.

Aceable, maker of a popular driving school app, asked for pitches for content campaigns focused on the dangers of driving while texting or distracted driving. They asked for trustworthy content to engage their base â€” learners and new drivers.

We pitched the concept of interviewing YouTube influencers who can reach teen and young adult audiences better.

CHALLENGE

Aceable aimed to grow revenue from their online driver's education, which is available through desktop and mobile apps. Their strategy was to use content marketing to increase engagement on websites they own, including DriversEd.com and IDriveSafely.com.

The campaign's key audiences included teens, new drivers, young adults (ages 15 - 24). Generation Z are generally open to new brands, but many don't like (or see) traditional marketing. So, how can a highly desirable service, paving the way to a coveted driver's license, reach the millions of people who'd benefit? 

SOLUTION

Fuel pitched the concept of interviewing YouTube influencers who have sway with younger, Gen-Z audiences. We selected influencers in Fuel's network who are relatable to young people, but also would please their parents.

Our editorial style and content strategy was to create interviews that don't just repeat key safety messages, but also give a glimpse in the lives of these interesting and successful adults.

RESULTS

Aceable published content to forge new and deeper connections among teens, young adults and parents. Our idea of working with YouTubers and experts was adopted in Aceable's content strategy.

The influencers we worked with were satisfied with their forays outside video and saw value in their voluntary contributions in return for exposure with a national brand. Further, Fuel's relationships with influencers on this project yielded new ideas and opportunities.
