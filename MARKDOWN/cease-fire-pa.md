CASE STUDY

A Show of Strength

Here's how our PR expert brought the media spotlight to a massive gun violence prevention rally in Pennsylvania.

 

Summary

Pennsylvania not-for-profit CeaseFirePA aims to end the epidemic of gun violence, which takes more than 1,500 lives a year in the state.

 

The small staff was organizing what was to become the biggest gun violence prevention rally ever in Pennsylvania, an event that was sure to get noticed by elected officials. But to get the change they sought, CeaseFirePA also needed to grab the attention of people in contested districts. People who vote. So, they hired Dave Scholnick, a media expert to help with PR. 

 

Challenge

CeaseFirePA’s event was going to be massive, but that alone wouldn’t draw statewide media coverage to a demonstration in Harrisburg, PA. How do you get big-market press to cover a small-market event?

With buses bringing activists from around the state, and turnout expected to strain the capacity of the Capitol Rotunda, CeaseFirePA’s staff was stretched thin.

 

Solution

CeaseFirePA hired media and communications specialist Dave Scholnick to help attract broad press coverage and penetrate hyper-local media markets.

 

Dave worked with Executive Director Shira Goodman to craft a strategy to garner media attention in the big markets and hometown stories in key suburbs. They submitted multiple op-eds to big and medium newspapers and leveraged relationships to ensure the story landed in the right hands.

 

Next, Dave pitched several of the bus pickups as their own stories to a deep list of large and local news outlets. He distributed talking points to designated volunteer coordinators on each bus and issued targeted local media advisories with logistical details.

 

Results

Pennsylvanians witnessed dramatic reports on television and radio in the state’s three biggest media markets. Readers woke up to stories in major metropolitan daily papers and small town weeklies across the state. #EveryGunEverySale trended on Twitter during the rally.

One reporter in a key Philadelphia suburb covered the bus pickup and then rode with activists to Harrisburg for a front-page story.

 

The media push generated coverage across channels to a combined circulation, viewership, and listenership of more than 1.6 million Pennsylvanians.



“Dave recognized our needs and maximized our media coverage. His strategic writing and thinking amplified our voice and extended our reach. It moved our agenda forward." — Shira Goodman, Executive Director, CeaseFirePA

Here's how our PR expert brought the media spotlight to a massive gun violence prevention rally in Pennsylvania.

Background
     
Pennsylvania not-for-profit CeaseFirePA aims to end the epidemic of gun violence across the Commonwealth and the country through education, coalition building, and advocacy. 

They organized a rally to take a stand against gun violence, which would become one of the largest assemblies in Pennsylvania's Capitol in Harrisburg. Media relations expert, Dave Scholnick, developed a strategy to attract media attention to this historic event.

Challenge

CeaseFirePA wanted to mount a powerful action in support of legislation to end an exemption that allows the purchase of an assault weapon without a background check.  

If hundreds turned up in Harrisburg, CeaseFirePA would get the attention  of politicians, but to really  make an impact, they needed to communicate with voters across the Commonwealth.

CeaseFirePA didn't have the staff and resources to deploy media representatives across Pennsylvania. But, they needed a strategy beyond press releases and newspaper editorials, which wouldn't reach smaller media markets.

Solution

CeaseFirePA hired media Dave Scholnick, communications expert, to help attract broad press coverage and penetrate hyper-local media markets.

Dave worked with CeaseFirePA executive director, Shira Goodman, to craft a strategy to generate hometown stories. Dave pitched the idea that bus pickups across Pennsylvania could attract local media for this major event.

Dave and CeaseFirePA tapped relationships with reporters to ensure the story landed in the right hands. And Dave's idea of training bus drivers as media liaisons was an ingenious press relations strategy. Dave coordinated media at the bus stops and trained bus drivers.

How a citizens group organized the largest gun violence prevention rally ever in Pennsylvania and was catapulted to the national stage. 

161 words

In Spring 2016, CeaseFirePA was planning Pennsylvania’s biggest gun violence prevention rally ever. Top legislators and gun violence survivors were scheduled to speak, and 11 buses were booked to carry activists from around the country. 

The Challenge: Consumed with politics and logistics, the staff just didn’t have the bandwidth to take advantage of the media opportunities the rally presented. This event was big. But to get outlets outside Harrisburg to cover it would take hard work and creative thinking.

The Solution: Dave Scholnick wored with Executive Director Shira Goodman to craft a strategyk to pitch hometown stories in communities where activists would board buses. Combined with traditional tactics, including op-eds, a strong press release, and old-fashioned relationship building, the strategy succeeded in earning headlines across the state. 

“Dave recognized our needs and helped us develop a plan that maximized our media coverage,” Shira said. “His strategic writing and thinking amplified our voice and extended our reach. It moved our agenda forward.”

Each day in America, 100 people are killed with guns. Pennsylvania’s share is close to 1,500 per year. With these life-and-death stakes looming, CeaseFirePA planned the biggest gun violence prevention rally in Pennsylvania history in the state’s capital, Harrisburg.

Top legislators were scheduled to speak; 11 buses were booked to bring activists from around the state. Executive director Shira Goodman and her staff were consumed with politics and logistics. There was no bandwidth to execute the communications work needed for an event like this. 

Shira asked Dave Scholnick what it would take to get press coverage across the state for an rally that took place in a small media market. With all the work and all the people giving up their day to be there, she couldn’t afford to waste the opportunity.

In addition to submitting a series of op-eds, Dave suggested targeting local media in communities where activists would board buses. He tailored nine individual advisories and created a talking points memo for bus captains who might speak to reporters.

The strategy worked both conceptually and practically. It spotlighted a set of hometown stories that wouldn’t compete against the big event. Pennsylvanians witnessed dramatic reports on television and radio in the state’s three biggest media markets. Readers woke up to stories in major metropolitan daily papers and small town weeklies across the state. One suburban reporter boarded the bus and rode with activists to the rally for a cover story on the trip.

“Dave recognized our needs and helped us develop a plan that maximized our media coverage,” Shira said. “His strategic writing and thinking amplified our voice and extended our reach. It moved our agenda forward.”
