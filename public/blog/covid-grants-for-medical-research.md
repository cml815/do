Applicants may include CC, CC derivatives with reproducible genomes and/or CC-RIX mice to accomplish these goals. Research areas supported by this FOA include immune system development, function or regulation; mechanisms governing immune response to infectious pathogens, vaccines or adjuvants; host susceptibility factors and mechanisms of pathogen-induced immunopathology; and immune mechanisms involved in the development and progression of immune-mediated diseases, such as allergy/asthma, autoimmunity, primary immunodeficiency, inflammation, and cell/organ/tissue transplant rejection or tolerance.
