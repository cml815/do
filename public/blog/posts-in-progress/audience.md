You want your technology company be authentic, trustworthy and relevant to those who need you. But, how do tell your story if your service or product is highly technical. 

The challenge is to balance talk on specifications with the greater purpose -- how you   achieve user goals faster and better. This is an issue clients of Fuel Copy faced, but they devised ingenious solutions. Here are some ideas to inspire your marketing strategy.

1) User success stories 

Storytelling connects companies and end users. offer with people seeking care. One powerful storytelling method is the conveying a specific, personal testimony, which is relatable to others. Potential patients are drawn to such stories because they reveal details of diagnosis, treatment and aftercare. An effective story tells of the patient's journey, which is a recounting of key moments of a person's road to health and wellness. These stories are positive and hopeful, but also are candid about challenges and answer the concerns a prospective patient or family member may have.

These stories commonly appear in print, but using dynamic media such as video gives more dimension to the narrative. Video stories can be structured in short segments like episodes in a television program. The advantages of breaking a long story in briefer sections is the content is more easily viewed and shared. Also, more content encourages audiences to return to a hospital's website, YouTube channel and Facebook page. 

2) Emotionally-compelling offline media 

Despite the explosion of digital media, healthcare can still benefit by reaching audiences with conventional media like TV and print. However, not everyone is yet on the Internet, particular older adults. According to Pew Research Center, 36% of adults over 65 are not online.

Online marketing has become an increasingly crowded space where many scroll past content or disable ads. Print media is diverse and offers tangible and visually arresting  content in the form of brochures, magazine/news features, help guides and billboards. Print's enduring nature can make it more impactful than fleeting online messages.     

3) Integrated digital and offline campaigns 

Hospitals can take advantage of the relative benefits digital and offline media by using both in integrated campaigns. Chief marketing officers know that people do not choose a hospital or provider based on a single contact. While repeated contacts from the same medium such as Facebook grow engagement, a mixed digital-offline strategy may work better. 

As an example, Borshoff launched an integrated rebranding campaign for the Franciscan Alliance. The challenge was to introduce a unified health system, which provides care through 14 hospitals and 18,000 employees in the Midwest. The campaign's main message was "14 hospitals. One mission." The campaign told stories of doctors, nurses and patients using the website, video and print media to give insights on what the health system means to them. 

4) Social media 

Social media has become a gathering place where hospital staff and patients meet. Hospitals use social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) to share health messages and to respond quickly to patient questions or concerns.  

Increasingly, patients and families are using social media within the hospital itself, according to Healthcare IT News. Stories of a new baby, recovery from an injury or illness, and gratitude for doctors and nurses are among the messages being shared on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Hospitals can find and follow the stories and generate a dialogue. 

5) YouTube channels and podcasts

YouTube video programs and podcasting have exploded in popularity and rival TV and radio. These media are most effective when producing regular, relevant content, which draws a repeat and new audiences. Hospitals have numerous choices in what content to produce, ranging from provider-centered content to health and wellness programs. Programming often offers authoritative health information in a reassuring or even entertaining format.
