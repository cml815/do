## General Questions

What is research and development funding?

Biomedical and science research and development (R&D) in the U.S. is largely funded through the government and industry. 

While research and development are grouped together, they have different aims. 

Federal research grants and contracts are conferred  to organizations, including higher education, research institutes, medical centers, and small and large businesses.

Industry often hires in-house scientists to perform research and development to advance technology and pipeline products. In some cases, companies will contract with other companies to perform studies, analyze data and other research tasks. These usually contractual relationships and not issued as grants. 

Are there seed grants for research?

Seed funding is rare because researchers usually have carried out preliminary research before applying for grants. 

However, researchers must start somewhere and many higher education institutions have department funds available for small research projects and pilot studies. 

Often, this internal research is competitive, meaning you must apply. The best way to find such funding opportunities is to find the funding opportunities on your institution's website. Or contact your Office of Sponsored Research. 

## Applying 


## Rejections & Reapplying

Why do my proposals keep getting turned down?

You are owed some explanation or information about why your research proposal has been declined. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) send reports of reviewer scoring and comments. 

You are advised to discuss your Summary Statements with your Program Officer. 

If you are being rejected by a foundation or company, then it's possible there is less feedback. 

Even in the absence of feedback, you can review your proposal against the merit review criteria. Also, check the eligibility criteria for the grant. If you aren't eligible, then a applicant is rejected without review.
