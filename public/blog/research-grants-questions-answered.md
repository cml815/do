## General Questions

What is research and development funding?

Biomedical and science research and development (R&D) in the U.S. is largely funded through the government and industry. 

While research and development are grouped together, they have different aims. Research that receives public grant funding is meant to uncover new knowledge for some public benefit. 

Development research is more focused on the work required to bring an innovation to market. 

Who is eligible for a federal R&D grant?

Federal research grants and contracts are conferred  to organizations, including higher education, research institutes, medical centers, and small and large businesses. 

Often there is a Project Director or Principal Investigator named in the grant and leads the research work. 

Companies of all sizes may be eligible for research grants, although large businesses compete for contracts, not grants. There is much more federal contract funding than grant funding. 

However, federal grant funding to small businesses is common through the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs. 

Are there federal grants to individuals or unincorporated sole proprietors?

No, but small businesses of any size are eligible for small business grants. 

Are there seed grants for research?

Seed funding is rare because researchers usually have carried out preliminary research before applying for grants. 

However, researchers must start somewhere and many higher education institutions have department funds available for small research projects and pilot studies. 

Often, this internal research is competitive, meaning you must apply. The best way to find such funding opportunities is to find the funding opportunities on your institution's website. Or contact your Office of Sponsored Research. 

## Applying 


## Rejections & Reapplying

Why do my proposals keep getting turned down?

You are owed some explanation or information about why your research proposal has been declined. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) send reports of reviewer scoring and comments. 

You are advised to discuss your Summary Statements with your Program Officer. 

If you are being rejected by a foundation or company, then it's possible there is less feedback. 

Even in the absence of feedback, you can review your proposal against the merit review criteria. Also, check the eligibility criteria for the grant. If you aren't eligible, then a applicant is rejected without review.
