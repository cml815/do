Small business innovation research (SBIR) grants help launch innovative projects and solve human problems, such as those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's a simple guide to SBIR grants, so you can decide if this funding source is right for you.

## What is the purpose of grants?

Funding is awarded as grants or contracts that arise from federal funds. The Small Business Administration coordinates this program and provides helpful information for applicants. 

The primary purpose is to support research and development (R&D) in areas aligned with federal priorities. Each agency that offers SBIR describes its priorities on its website and funding opportunity. Also, the SBA offers a handy [explainer](https://www.sbir.gov/tutorials/individual-agency-requirements/), which summarizes agency priorities.

## How can my company benefit from these awards?
 
Grant awards are not loans and don't need to be repaid. Therefore, if your company has a business objective that aligns well with federal priorities, you can benefit from this win-win situation. 

Further, grants are non-dilutive, which means that you are not required to give up any ownership. 

## Is my business eligible? 

The principal investigator (research project lead) must be employed by the small company. Also, the proposing company must perform at least two-thirds (66%) of the work during Phase I and at 50% or more in Phase II <a href="blog-link" href="https://www.sbir.gov/applicants">Source: SBA</a>

The company must not have more than 500 employees. There are no revenue limits for SBIR, which differs from the SBA's defnition. 

There are some caveats with eligibility, especially around complex ownership arrangements, including venture capital firms and hedge funds.  The SBA has a detailed <a href="blog-link" href="https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf">Eligibility Guide.</a>

## How much funding can I get?

Approximately, $2.5 billion of SBIR funding is available to small businesses. Eleven federal agencies set aside a portion (around 3%) of their R&D budget to SBIR grants. Agencies, which are larger, have more funding to give. For example, the Department of Defense, the largest agency, offers about $1 billion in SBIR grants per year. 

Awards vary based on what type of funding you apply. Phase I awards are the most common way to win a grant, especially for a beginning is generally limited to **$150,000**. This grant is meant to demonstrate a proof of concept, and if successful, then you would be eligible for Phase II funding. 

Phase II awardees show success in their pilot Phase I grant and are encouraged to apply for a **$1 million** award over two years. 

Direct to Phase II (DP2) is a way for applicants to bypass Phase I and receive a Phase II grant. This pathway is not adopted by all federal agencies. Check SBIR funding announcements to see if DP2 is available. 

## I want to apply. How do I start? 

To begin, you want to find and read an opportunity announcement that fits you. 

There are several ways to find funding opportunities. For a user-friendly experience, check out: <a class="blog-link" href = "https://www.sbir.gov/solicitations/open"><p>Open Opportunity list on SBIR.gov</p></a>



Also, Grants.gov is useful, especially in downloading an application package. <a class="blog-link" href = "https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html?keywords=SBIR"><p>Use "SBIR" as a serarch term.</p></a>


Some SBIR opportunities are more general while others are very specific. Searching today, I pulled an SBIR looking for cryogenic technology for Drosophilia (fruit flies). You'll need some persistence to find an opportunity that fits your company. 

## Are there COVID-19 specific SBIR grants?

You are welcome to submit COVID-related projects, if they fit an agency's priorities. At this moment, there are only a handful of Coronavirus specific grant opportunities. But that doesn't mean that funders won't welcome an innovative COVID-19 project that would bring substantial relief from the epidemic (e.g., better testing, epidemiological models, etc.).

## I found the perfect opportunity. What's next?

Read the opportunity and pass it along to your team, especially to your Chief Scientific Officer. Generate a list of questions and email the relevant contact. Every opportunity has a contact person or a Program Officer. Developing a rapport with a Program Officer is valuable because they help you over time.
