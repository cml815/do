Founders seeking help on small business grants such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant will find an avalanche of online information. However, small company executives call Fuel with one question, "Where do I start?"

Online tutorials will explain the mechanical tasks of proposal writing, which are useful in navigating the onerous grant application process. 

But guides aren't great at inspiring a company to risk a lot of work for unknown returns. Only 1 in 5 SBIR applications are funded and wins favor companies who already have a history of success.

## How to begin? 

Many new applicants want a sounding board for their specific situation, including their research concept and their likelihood of winning a grant. Common questions I hear:

Befriending winners you find online, at a conference or even in your own company yield great benefits. 

## Talk to your contacts in the federal government

Have you discussed your project with an SBIR/STTR contact yet? If you haven't, I encourage you to do so within the next week or two.

SBIR/STTR program staff have one primary mission -- to support those who ask for help. 

If your project falls under Health and Human Services, then here's a [directory of program staff](https://sbir.nih.gov/engage/ic-contacts) divided by therapeutic area. 

## Recruit collaborators

While a Phase I grants confers a miniscule amount of money (150K), many winners are able to leverage powerful partnerships. 

University-company partnerships are often effective in allowing a business to carry out complex research. The university's state-of-the-art facilities
