You may be overwhelmed by the number of grant and contract opportunities

An opportunity surfaces and you have to act fast. You read a request for proposal (RFP) that fits you and think, "What do I have to lose?" But, any bid for a contract or funding comes risk. Therefore, you need to evaluate the opportunity cost or what you could lose. Here are some things to consider in take the time, money and labor required to win a contract bid.

## What is the deadline?

RFP announcements often remain online long after the deadline has passed. Check the deadline, but don't despair if you have missed your chance. Some opportunities are re-released at a set amount of time (typically 1-5 years).

## Are you eligible?

RFPs offer basic information that you should review to see if you are eligible. Eligibility generally fall in these categories:

- Size of business (for small business grants)
- Geography (city, state or country)
- Relevant experience 
- Other regulatory requirements 

Often you can call or email a program contact for more information. Usually that information is provided within the RFP. 

## What are opportunity costs? 

What will you lose if you pursue a potential win? Opportunity cost is intuitive and it rules our professional and lives. Pursuing one direction over another means  funding comes with opportunity cost. That cost is the benefit you lose from choosing a funding option over another. For example, let's say you bid on a $1 million opportunity over pursuing a $100K account. 

Sometimes it's tempting to "go big,"

Opportunity cost is the benefit you may forgo choosing one course of action over another. You can determine the opportunity cost of choosing one investment option over another by using the following formula: Opportunity Cost = Return on Most Profitable Investment Choice - Return on Investment Chosen to Pursue.

## Who is the competition?

Often RFPs are released to fit certain competitors. That may be because these companies already have the contract or provided RFP language in advance. Therefore, these RFPs reward those already delivering or are in the know. This reality can be daunting, but you can find a seat at the table, especially if this is a local or state contract and you are connected to policy priorities and budgets. 

Grants tend to be more blinded in terms of who wins the award. Experience matters, of course, but a feasible plan and evidence of success matters. For example, small business grants (Small Business Innovation Research) are reviewed by expert scientific and business panels and are meant to distribute funding widely. 

## How difficult will it be to meet requirements?

Virtually all proposals require additional resources including staff, facilities and technology. If you are already doing most of the activities required in a grant or contract, it is much easier to extend your work. The more resources you have to procure, such as a project director, the more difficult it will be to create a competitive project.
