1. I wanted to start a blog and thought it was going to be pretty straightforward but as it turned out, it wasn't. So I put an ad out on LinkedIn for some help. Caroline responded very quickly and offered her help building this website and getting it up and running for me. 
2. Caroline and I first talked on the phone about what I was expecting and what I wanted out of this blog. She did not rush me and was very enthusiastic about helping me through this process. We agreed on what the work would entail and she began working immediately. She helped me so much to get my blog up and running and walked me through the issues I was having to help me understand it better. 
3. There were some mishaps along the way with the system, itself, but Caroline always responded quickly with any questions I had and worked through this issue until it was fixed. I'm so grateful for all she has done!
