tripods all the time crappy tripod review -- take more time away from me 

I'm actually

When I'm partnered or got the product for free, I will 

Wows me, this doesn't work. Nothing's perfect, pros and cons. I really enjoyed this product for what it was. 

Sometimes you get cricket. Quick beta test. Fix version Amazon sellers not only buying the product. Resellers. Usually don't respond.

Tipped over and almost broke my phone.

Cell phone tripods recently

Facebook ads - (looking at my numbers)

Larger companies will look at smaller channels because they have a bigger spend and get a reach. Smaller companies. --

Wanted a freebie. Initially, reached out to larger brands. Cool and small. Make a partnership and stop wanting to get a freebie. Stopped being greedy. I'll give it a shot Greenroom136 - bike messengering. 

Reload - custom messenger bag - out of Philly - 6 degrees - wife Jonathana Levine - 2nd and Spring Garden - BK tin man alley gallery space. Standard Tap - wife - The bag I bought came out of the building. 

Where my bag obsession started? I just love backpacks.

Patrick Greenroom136 - custom bags out messenger bags addiction, until hurt shoulder, get in and out of it quickly. Like backpacks. Greenroom136 --> liked it. Partnership -- more honest review from a smaller channel. User review different than a paid advertisement. 

Pitched Patrick and he liked it. We did reviews of different bags. Affiliate program and link. Patrick said bag is "doing great" and then reach out to Chase Reeves. Greenroom136. He's not paying me, but Skype chats with Patrick -- address that and fix it. Send a bag in production. get a free backpack and I'm addicted to backpacks

bags - made suggestions to me and send him. Gear bags

Who's going to buy what -- and what rises to the top. I'll check it out. Winner and sometimes it's not. Not take hours bashing something other people don't want. Lose lose.

Electric skateboards - lots of companies - discount - so stopped replying, so I didn't get the information to finish the review.

-People like negative reviews. 
Highest viewed video on my channel 66,000 reviews - a popular backpack - expensive. Macbook of camera bags. A status symbol. They have $2,000 to spend to do email (He is a Macbook pro user because video edidting)

Expensive backpack - doesn't function right - Hipster backpack for camera people

You love it? You don't even own it. Try it for a couple of weeks, it doesn't function. 100 views per hour to 10 views per hour. 

Generates controversy. Lots of people eat it up no name tripod. Product people of I spent $300 of my own money. It sucked and sold it on eBay. 

The world according to Briggs, LA and did a livestream in Portland, Oregon, volunteered to help. Holmesdale -- Lyft videos -- negative videos have triple the views. Livestreams on the area. 

Livestreams are a good way to connect with an audience. It's immediate. Just talk. With a 7-month old, it's easier to answer all of the questions. To be seen, make a donations to a person - get a shoutout.  

Free tattoo, but an aftermath. Have friends of yours. We're friends you did for me. Friends with those guys before they owned their own shop. Now, best shop in the area. 


-You're a real user but more right. You've been doing this work FT for many years?
-Do companies send you freebies or you buy it yourself or both?
-Is there any difference w/ how review a freebie or a bought product?
-Have you built relationships with video camera, software or gear makers as a result of YT and work?

Video and promos to help and promote my friends.

Not just filming and editing, it's a whole lot more. People want to be YouTubers, but they don't get it's an overnight sensation. Took off 2009/2010 video went viral. Video starting picking, but you didn't make a liviing.


Unitl 5 years agoo, trade show vid or TV ad. Now, everything is for social media. Instagram's 60-second videos, that "turned heads". That opened the floodgates for people.

See a handful of creators getting rich. I want to be that. There's so much more. 

Film 2-3 hours of raw footage. And make a story. Couldn't get footage, raw footage. Make a story and a flow. 

Rambling walk around linear order. My early videos were crap and I knew it was crap. I knew how to film and edit, but I had to do it to learn. People don't want to learn but grow their numbers.

YouTube comments
-YT comments have a terrible reputation. You respond to almost all of your comments, even the critical. 
-Users dialogue with you in a 

Try to be polite. Don't have to put on the fake smile. I block certain expletives, which will go to a spam filter. 

Community tab. Check in every day and will delete rude and racist. Sometimes if someone is insulting. Sometime it turns it into a conversation

I don't have to be nice. This isn't retail or a restaurant. 

So many comments, the same comment "you're wearing an apple watch."

The exact same comment and I'll let is pass.


Product/topic, someone weighs in with more information because they know more turning into longer topic discussion.

Corrections: pinned to the topic. YouTube used to do annotations on the screen. Can't do it anymore.

Vimeo lets you update a video. 

YouTube going towards YouTube Red --> Throw up really fast. And replace it with a different video. 

Content creators put specific content. YouTube doing own Amazon and Netflix. 


It's all about money.
