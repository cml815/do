In Spring 2016, CeaseFirePA was planning Pennsylvania’s biggest gun violence prevention rally ever. Top legislators and gun violence survivors were scheduled to speak, and 11 buses were booked to carry activists from around the country. 

The Challenge: Consumed with politics and logistics, the staff just didn’t have the bandwidth to take advantage of the media opportunities the rally presented. This event was big. But to get outlets outside Harrisburg to cover it would take hard work and creative thinking.

The Solution: Dave Scholnick worked with Executive Director Shira Goodman to craft a strategy to pitch hometown stories in communities where activists would board buses. Combined with traditional tactics, including op-eds, a strong press release, and old-fashioned relationship building, the strategy succeeded in earning headlines across the state. 

“Dave recognized our needs and helped us develop a plan that maximized our media coverage,” Shira said. “His strategic writing and thinking amplified our voice and extended our reach. It moved our agenda forward.”

Each day in America, 100 people are killed with guns. Pennsylvania’s share is close to 1,500 per year. With these life-and-death stakes looming, CeaseFirePA planned the biggest gun violence prevention rally in Pennsylvania history in the state’s capital, Harrisburg.

Top legislators were scheduled to speak; 11 buses were booked to bring activists from around the state. Executive director Shira Goodman and her staff were consumed with politics and logistics. There was no bandwidth to execute the communications work needed for an event like this. 

Shira asked Dave Scholnick what it would take to get press coverage across the state for an rally that took place in a small media market. With all the work and all the people giving up their day to be there, she couldn’t afford to waste the opportunity.

In addition to submitting a series of op-eds, Dave suggested targeting local media in communities where activists would board buses. He tailored nine individual advisories and created a talking points memo for bus captains who might speak to reporters.

The strategy worked both conceptually and practically. It spotlighted a set of hometown stories that wouldn’t compete against the big event. Pennsylvanians witnessed dramatic reports on television and radio in the state’s three biggest media markets. Readers woke up to stories in major metropolitan daily papers and small town weeklies across the state. One suburban reporter boarded the bus and rode with activists to the rally for a cover story on the trip.

“Dave recognized our needs and helped us develop a plan that maximized our media coverage,” Shira said. “His strategic writing and thinking amplified our voice and extended our reach. It moved our agenda forward.”
