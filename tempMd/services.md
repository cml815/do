## Benefits of grants and contracts

        We help organizations successfully compete for grants and contracts. We've helped secure $50M for forward-thinking visionaries who founded projects that sustain health, hope and happiness.



Public agencies reward companies and not-for-profits for solving important problems in cost-effective ways. Billions of dollars finance a variety of health and technology projects. 

We help our clients describe their projects in a credible and compelling way. By pulling from our past experience and research, we can give concrete advice on what funders want.

Frequently Asked Questions

How do I find grant and contract opportunities?

All publicly-funded opportunities are listed on funder websites. Federal grants are found on Grants.gov and contracts are found on FBO.gov. You can find contract opportunities on state and municipality websites. 

We follow many federal and state opportunities and point you in the right direction. Feel fee to ask; we're happy to help. 

Am I eligible for a small business innovation research (SBIR) grant?

The small business administration has helpful FAQs on this topic. The eligibility is fairly broad, but successful companies are already in operation, capable of doing R&D mostly in-house, and have promising preliminary data. 

What is your success rate? 

Grant and contract competitions are intense with <1% to 20% award rates. Our award rates vary by opportunity and applicant's experience (range 15% to 70%).

Generally, we only work on projects where winning is possible. For example, many contract procurements already have favored vendors. And we won't advise an applicant to "go for it" if they don't meet minimum criteria for selection.

Can I pay you on commission, if I win the grant?

We don't work on commission for two reasons: 1) most funders do not allow proposal costs in the budget, so paying a grant writer is a serious breach of the rules and  2) the proposal effort, even if you lose, brings value to you in terms of learning and identifying resources. We're happy to advise you and do some other things for free, but we charge for proposal writing.
