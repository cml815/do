## Benefits of grants and contracts

We help organizations successfully compete for grants and contracts. We've helped secure $50M for forward-thinking visionaries who founded projects that sustain health, hope and happiness.

Public agencies reward companies and not-for-profits for solving important problems in cost-effective ways. 

The U.S. government distributes billions of dollars in grants and contracts for healthcare, technology and human services. Often, this is a competitive process that requires a formal proposal submission.  

Funding has a high return on investment. Grant winners often can leverage further funding and investment. Companies value grants because they are non-dilutive, meaning founders don't give up equity. 

Public contracts offer companies reliable, longterm public customers. 

# What we do

Our singular purpose is to help you win. 

Winning a grant or contract is cause for celebration, but getting to that win is a long, arduous process. Proposal submissions often are hundreds (even thousands!) of pages.    
We help our clients describe their projects and their value in a credible and compelling way. By pulling from our past experience and research, we can give concrete advice on what funders want. Also, we execute the proposal writing and attachment creation with the full involvement of the client team.

Who we help

We work with not-for-profits, startups, health centers and universities.    

How we help

We excel across the full-spectrum of activities needed to create a proposal that scores highly on the funder's review criteria. 

Our process

We begin with a free consultation to discuss a grant or contract opportunity and the client's strengths. 

Then, we make a plan and race the deadline clock. We work in small teams to make sure everything gets done in time and at the highest possible quality. 

We work with our clients to communicate the proposal demands, collect data, brainstorm ideas and write.

Frequently Asked Questions

How do I find grant and contract opportunities?

All publicly-funded opportunities are listed on funder websites. Federal grants are found on Grants.gov and contracts are found on FBO.gov. You can find contract opportunities on state and municipality websites. 

We follow many federal and state opportunities and point you in the right direction. Feel fee to ask; we're happy to help. 

What is your success rate? 

Grant and contract competitions are intense with <1% to 20% award rates. Our award rates vary by opportunity and applicant's experience (range 15% to 70%).

We only work on projects where winning is possible. For example, many contract procurements already have favored vendors. And we won't advise you to "go for it" if your project doesn't meet minimum criteria for selection.

Can you help me re-apply for grants?

Yes, we welcome reapplicants. The majority of people applying for federal grants (especially NIH grants) have to try 2-3 times to win a grant.

We analyze your proposal and review comments and help you improve the weaker aspects of your proposal. 

Am I eligible for a small business innovation research (SBIR) grant?

The small business administration has helpful FAQs on this topic. Keep in mind that SBIR funds research and development, so it won't fund commercialization activity. 

Can I pay you on commission, if I win the grant?

We don't work on commission for two reasons: 1) most funders do not allow proposal or other pre-award costs in the budget and 2) the proposal effort, even if you lose, brings you tremendous value. We're happy to give you an initial consultation for free, but we charge for proposal services.
