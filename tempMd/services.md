## Intro

We help you accelerate growth and launch novel solutions by successfully competing for grant funding and contracts. 

## Why public funding matters

Public agencies reward companies and not-for-profits for solving important problems in cost-effective ways. 

Grants and contracts have a high return on investment. Winners have resources to expand and can leverage success for more funding and investment. 

Companies especially value grants because they are non-dilutive, meaning founders don't give up equity. 

Public contracts offer companies and not-for-profits reliable, recurring and long-term revenue. 

# What we do

Our singular purpose is to help you win. We apply decades of experience, research and tools to help your proposal score highly with reviewers.  

Creating a winning proposal is a long, arduous process. Proposal submissions often are hundreds (even thousands!) of pages. We take over much of the burden, so you can focus on your work, family and life.    

We help our clients describe their projects and their value in a credible and compelling way. By pulling from our past experience and research, we can give concrete advice on what funders want. Also, we execute the proposal writing and attachment creation with the full involvement of the client team.

Specifics on how we help

Advising

We'll interpret the request for proposals (RFP), so you understand funder priorities and what you are asked to do. Also, we can find opportunities for you. 

Proposal development

A typical proposal tells your story in three different ways: 1) narrative about you and your project, 2) detailed budget, and 3) data and plans giving strong evidence of your capacity. 

Depending on your needs, we'll advise on and write any or all aspects of the proposal. 

Mock reviews and editing 

Subject matter or funding experts will review and score your proposal. These insights are meant to bring your draft from good to great. 

Technical support

We help new applicants register and complete requirements need to submit their first proposal. For seasoned applicants, we can help with any technical issues or errors they face during final application upload. 

# Our qualifications &amp; and track record

We've helped secure $50M for those who champion health, social justice and innovations for the common good. 

We've had the honor to help win about $50M for groundbreaking projects. And we have advised dozens of physicians, researchers and entrepreneurs who have invented ways to solve complex problems.  

"What is your success rate?"

Grant and contract competitions are intense with <1% to 20% award rates. Our award rates vary by opportunity and applicant's experience (range 15% to 70%). Numerous first-timers won funding with our help, although reapplying is a reality for intense competitions. 

We know that about 10% of submissions fail due to preventable mistakes -- upload errors, missing information or misinterpretation of the RFP. We help you avoid those pitfalls. 

Who we help

We partner with not-for-profits, startups, health centers and universities. Typically, we work with teams who contribute their expertise and make sure the proposal represents the work.

Our process

We begin with a free consultation to discuss a grant or contract opportunity and learn more about you. 

We are candid about your chances and give you insights on how agencies make funding decisions. Sometimes the requirements seem daunting, but we've seen small projects get large awards.  

Then, we make a plan and race the deadline clock. We work in small teams to make sure everything gets done in time and at the highest possible quality. 

We work with our clients to communicate the proposal demands, collect data, brainstorm ideas and craft a logical,persuasive proposal.
