    <h2>How we help</h2>
    <p>We help you convey your project's value in a credible and compelling way. Drawing from 20+ years of experience, we can give practical advice on what funders want. Also, we work with you to execute a perfect ask &mdash; cases of support, pitches and proposals.</p>

        <h4>Who we help</h4>
        <p>We partner with not-for-profits, startups, health centers and universities. Typically, we work with teams who contribute their expertise and make sure the proposal represents the work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel__text">
      <h4>Rewards</h4>
      <p>Donations and grants have a high return on investment. Winners have extra resources to grow. Less struggle, more progress.</p>
      <p>Fundraising is relational, as people give to people. Funders trust a winner. Funding is social proof you are more likely to succeed.</p>
      <p>Companies especially value grants because they are non-dilutive, meaning founders don't give up equity.</p>
      <p>Contracts offer companies and not-for-profits reliable, recurring and long-term revenue.</p>
