      <h2>Rewards of fundraising</h2>
      <p>Donations and grants have a high return on investment. Winners have extra resources to grow. Less struggle, more progress.</p>
      <p>Fundraising is relational, as people give to people. Funders trust a winner. Funding is social proof you are more likely to succeed.</p>
      <p>Companies especially value grants because they are non-dilutive, meaning founders don't give up equity.</p>
      <p>Contracts offer companies and not-for-profits reliable, recurring and long-term revenue.</p>
