    <p>Fuel finds talented influencers who bring charisma, expertise and a <span class="bold">following</span> to team with brands.</p>
    <p>Aceable, makers of a popular <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aceable-driving-school-app/id766014676">driver's ed app</a>, asked for pitches on the dangers of driving while texting, which is known as distracted driving. They wanted trustworthy content to engage people learning to drive and new drivers.</p>
    <p>We pitched the concept of interviewing YouTube influencers who can reach teen and young adult audiences better.</p>

    <p>Fuel pitched the concept of interviewing YouTube influencers who have sway with younger, Gen-Z audiences. We selected influencers in Fuel's network who could relate to young people and their parents.</p> 
    <p>Our editorial style and content strategy was to create interviews that didn't just repeat key safety messages, but also gave a glimpse in the lives of these successful adults.</p>

    <h4>Consequences of distracted driving</h4>
      <p>Kaynen Brown, an emergency department nurse, gave a frontline view of the devastation of teen accidents for<a href="https://www.idrivesafely.com/defensive-driving/trending/teen-accidents-view-emergency-room">&nbsp;IDriveSafely.com</a>. 
      <p>As part of the content strategy, Aceable asked for content to tie into AAA's message that summer is the "100 Deadliest Days.</p>
      <p>Brown is more than an expert, he's a relatable role model. He is candid about his nursing career and sometimes a tough day inspires a video.</p>
      <p>Brown founded the ER Forum in 2016 and the YouTube channel has had a meteoric rise. His videos have gotten over 500,000 views and the channel is a leader in nursing content.</p><a class="" href="https://www.idrivesafely.com/defensive-driving/trending/teen-accidents-view-emergency-room"><p class="wordlink">Read the article.</p></a>
