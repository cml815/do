        How Companies Can Connect With Influencers
    </p>
    <p>
       Larger companies will look at smaller channels because they have a bigger spend and get a reach.

Jeff partnered with Jeff Lim, founder of Greenroom136 a maker of unique backpacks and urban gear. Greenroom136 has built a large following in the U.S. due to social media.

"I pitched Patrick the idea filming an honest review on my YouTube. As a true backpack addict, I'd be honest and enthusiastic. And he liked it."
    </p>
    <p>
        "People like negative reviews. The highest-viewed video on my channel was a negative review of a popular and expensive camera bag." 

The review generated controversy and that led to views as well as comments criticizing the video. Fans of the backpack wrote comments on the video. 

Highest viewed video on my channel 66,000 reviews - a popular backpack - expensive. Macbook of camera bags. A status symbol. They have $2,000 to spend to do email (He is a Macbook pro user because video edidting).
