    <h2>Benefits of grants and contracts</h2>
    <p>Public agencies reward companies and not-for-profits for solving important problems in cost-effective ways.</p>
    <p>Grants and contracts have a high return on investment. Winners have resources to expand and can leverage success for more funding and investment. </p>
    <p>Companies especially value grants because they are non-dilutive, meaning founders don't give up equity.</p>
    <p>Public contracts offer companies and not-for-profits reliable, recurring and long-term revenue.</p>
