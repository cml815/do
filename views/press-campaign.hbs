      <p class=fine-print>Challenge</p>
      <p>
          Consumed with politics and logistics, the staff just didn’t have the bandwidth to take advantage of the media opportunities the rally presented. This event was big. But to get outlets outside Harrisburg to cover it would take hard work and creative thinking.
      </p>
      <p class="fine-print">Solution</p> 
      <p>Dave Scholnick worked with Executive Director Shira Goodman to craft a strategy to pitch hometown stories in communities where activists would board buses. Combined with traditional tactics, including op-eds, a strong press release, and old-fashioned relationship building, the strategy succeeded in earning headlines across the state.</p>
