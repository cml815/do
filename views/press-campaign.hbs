    <p class="fine-print">Challenge</p>
    <p>CeaseFirePA saw an opportunity to mount a powerful action in support of legislation to reduce gun violence.</p>
    <p> If hundreds turned up in Harrisburg, CeaseFirePA would get the attention  of politicians, but to  make a real impact, they needed to communicate with voters across the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p>CeaseFirePA didn't have the staff and resources to deploy media representatives across Pennsylvania. But, they needed a strategy beyond press releases and newspaper editorials, which wouldn't reach smaller media markets.</p>

<article class="grid-solution-p">
      <p class="fine-print">Solution</p>
      <p>CeaseFirePA hired media Dave Scholnick, communications expert, to help attract broad press coverage and penetrate hyper-local media markets. </p>
      <p>Dave worked with CeaseFirePA executive director, Shira Goodman, to craft a strategy to generate hometown stories. Dave pitched the idea that bus pickups across Pennsylvania could attract local media for this landmark event.</p>
      <p> Dave and CeaseFirePA tapped relationships with reporters to ensure the story landed in the right hands. And Dave's idea of training bus drivers as media liaisons was an ingenious press relations strategy. Dave coordinated media at the bus stops and trained bus drivers.</p>
