    <p class="fine-print">Solution</p>
    <p>A team of Fuel writers conducted personalized outreach to in-house marketing/PR directors and to agencies.</p> 
    <p>All of the companies had remarkable success, in part because they had a story worth sharing. We began to understand what made a great success story.</p>
    <p>RewardExpert published and promoted these founder stories, which raised the profile of these companies to an audience of sophisticated travelers. And the increase in traffic and links has, in part, established RewardExpert as one of the top travel-tech websites in the world.</p>
