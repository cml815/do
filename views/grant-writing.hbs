    <h2>How we help</h2>

    <div class="panel__text">
        <h4>Who we help</h4>
        <p>We partner with not-for-profits, startups, health centers and universities. Typically, we work with teams who contribute their expertise and make sure the proposal represents the work.</p>

    <div class="panel__text">
      <h4>Rewards</h4>
      <p>Donations and grants have a high return on investment. Winners have extra resources to grow. Less struggle, more progress.</p>
      <p>Fundraising is relational, as people give to people. Funders trust a winner. Funding is social proof you are more likely to succeed.</p>
      <p>Companies especially value grants because they are non-dilutive, meaning founders don't give up equity.</p>
      <p>Contracts offer companies and not-for-profits reliable, recurring and long-term revenue.</p>

        <p>We begin with a free consultation to discuss a grant or contract opportunity and learn more about you. </p>
        <p>We'll discuss how to boost your odds for success and give you insights on how agencies make funding decisions. Sometimes the requirements seem daunting, but we've seen small projects get large awards.</p>
        <p>Then, we make a plan and race the deadline clock. We work in small teams to make sure everything gets done in time and at the highest possible quality.</p>
        <p>We work with our clients to communicate the proposal demands, collect data, brainstorm ideas and craft a logical, persuasive proposal. </p>

        <h4>"What is our success rate?"</h4>
        <p>We know competitions have < 5% to 20% award rates. So, success varies by whether you've won funds before and your fit for an opportunity. Our win record ranges from 15%to 60%.</p>
