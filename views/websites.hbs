      <p class="fine-print">Summary</p>
      <p>Fuel's niche is to help entrepreneurs gain traction with 'minimal but effective' marketing.</p>
      <p>We often work with medical or healthcare companies who fall in a category Googles calls, "Your Money Or Your Life." These companies are held to a higher standard because the stakes for consumers are high. Thus, success depends on a web presence that's useful and authoritative. </p>
      <p>We have helped create landing pages and websites designed to grow reach, attract leads and create avenues for dialogue and trust.</p>

    <p class="fine-print">Challenge</p>
    <p>When we work with health companies, they bring us similar questions. How to explain complex health solutions without glossing over the technical, but not alienate prospects with medical jargon?</p>
    <p>We have distilled the main challenge as understanding the needs that prospects have. And how do they browse online assets to move from awareness to decision.</p>

      <p class="center">As part of the 'Medic' update, Google rewarded websites with expertise, authority and trust (EAT) signals. The algorithm was meant for all, but important sites, include those in health and medical, made changes in how they published content.</p>

    <p>Our clients foster health and wellness by creating relationships. Often these relations start with giving &mdash; an inspiring post, clear information about a health problem or access to a clinical trial.</p>  
    <p>Fuel helps in ways to foster giving that leads to trust. We've designed landing pages and microsites that contain articles, list articles, interviews and user-generated content.</p>

    <p>Fuel wrote all the copy and content for the website, which showed visitors how they could benefit from easy-to-buy and use branding products. By emphasizing benefits over features, the website was able to connect on what mattered to prospective buyers.</p>
    <p>In addition, Fuel created a content strategy and initial blogs to enable the company to create a dialogue with its audience. Content marketing made the company more relatable by sharing insights about healthcare branding.</p>
